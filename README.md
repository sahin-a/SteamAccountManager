# SteamAccountManager
fresh steam acc manager (not useable yet)

** the console project isn't ready for use, it was used for testing **

TODO:
* further refactor infrastructure layer
* fetch steam apis to get additional informations about the accounts (e.x. profile picture, nickname etc.)
* build different frontends because why not
