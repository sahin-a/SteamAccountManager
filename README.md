# Steam Account Manager
It lets you switch between your steam accounts seamlessly. No Credentials are required, it works based on remembered logins from your steam client.

# Known Issues
App not launching?
- [Install .NET 6 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

Profile Picture, Level etc. not showing?
- After you launch the app for the first time, you should have a 'api_key.json' file in the root directory. 
- Enter the api key you get from here https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey in 'api_key.json'
